# Getting Started

Designed with simplicity in mind Uniswap provides an interface for seamless exchange of ERC20 tokens on Ethereum. By eliminating unnecessary forms of rent extraction and middlemen it allows faster, more efficient exchange. Where it makes tradeoffs, decentralization, censorship resistance, and security were prioritized above profitability. 

Uniswap is open source and functions as a public good. There is no central token or platform fee. No special treatment is given to early investors, adopters, or developers. Token listing is open and free. All smart contract functions are public and all upgrades are opt-in. 

This site will serve as a project overview for Uniswap - explaining how it works, how to use it, and how to build on top of it. These docs are actively being worked on and more information will be added soon.



### Uniswap V1 Features

### How it works

Uniswap is made up of a series of ETH-to-ERC20 exchange contracts. Exchange contracts can be created by anyone using the uniswap factory contract. The factory serves as a registry for all existing exchanges, and allows one exchange to be create registered per ERC20 token.
