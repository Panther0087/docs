# Get Started

Uniswap offers a [public REST API](https://github.com/Uniswap/uniswap-api) that returns a limited subset of recent market data primarily intended to help cryptocurrency exchange aggregators surface Uniswap trading data.

The API is powered by [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/), and uses the [open-source Uniswap subgraph](https://github.com/graphprotocol/uniswap-subgraph).
