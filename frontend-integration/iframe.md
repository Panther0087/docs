# Iframe Integration

Uniswap can be used within other sites as an Iframe. This Iframe shows an exact version of the uniswap.exchange site and can have custom prefilled settings. 

An example of an Iframe integration can be found on the FOAM site https://map.foam.space/#/at/?lng=-74.0045300&lat=40.6771800&zoom=5.00

To see the Iframe click the dropdown in the top right and click "get foam".

You can customize the page, selected tokens and more using URL query parameters. See https://docs.uniswap.io/frontend-integration/linking for more.
