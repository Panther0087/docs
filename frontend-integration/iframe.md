# Iframe Integration

Uniswap can be used within other sites as an Iframe. This Iframe shows an exact version of the uniswap.exchange site and can have custom prefilled settings. 

An example of an Iframe integration can be found on the FOAM site https://map.foam.space/#/at/?lng=-74.0045300&lat=40.6771800&zoom=5.00

To see the Iframe click the dropdown in the top right and click "get foam". 



The Uniswap front-end supports URL query parameters to allow for custom linking to the Uniswap exchange. Users and developers can use these query parameters to link to the Uniswap exchange with custom prefilled settings.
